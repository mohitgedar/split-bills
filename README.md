    4. push the changes on your forked repository 

    5. Make a pull request , wait for merging guidence for changes required


## Code Style and Guidelines:

    1. Your changes should be well commented , overcomment if you can

    2. While making changes try to be consious that you code such way that there are minimum
     conflict when merging

    3. Be upto date with the original file as much as you can and adjustyour code accordingly
     first hand , so later you don't have to modify too much to clear conflicts

    4. In javascript try to use functions for changes if possible , don't just hard code to
     already existing code or you can have a different js file altogether , but link it well


## feautures you can work on :

1. Add button on second page to remove the last entry of the entered **Name**

2. Add button on third page to remove the last **payment entry**

3. You can make the popup which appears when you make entry to come smoothly and then disappper smoothly  or it comes from one side and go to other side and disappear , **work on popup transition**

4. suggest more features in discussion section I will add them here for contributers to work on 

## Bugs you can work on 

1. At the second page , where we add names , if we refresh the page in middle after adding few name , the names that were being shown on the page don't show .most likely related to function renderpage and rendertopage in javascript.
